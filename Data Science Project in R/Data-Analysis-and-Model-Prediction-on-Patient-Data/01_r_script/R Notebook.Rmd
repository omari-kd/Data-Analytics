### Overview

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
This project analyses the data of many patients (approximately 2000). The first data contains demographic and simple measurements (height, weight, etc). The second data also contains the results of 5 medical tests ranging from 0 to 100. It also indicates whether or not the patient has a disease (0=yes, 1=no). Both files have an ID for each patient which uniquely identifies the patient. Thus patient 34573 in the first file is the same as 34573 in the second.

### Data Preparation

```{r}
data1 <- data.frame(read.table("./00_raw_data/Data1.txt", header = T))  
data2 <- data.frame(read.table("./00_raw_data/Data2.txt", header = T))
```

```{r}
# Use dplyr to merge data to keep positions of their ID
library(dplyr)

# Merge the data frames on the ID column
data <- left_join(data1, data2, by = "id")
View(data)
```

```{r}
# Check for duplicate
sum(duplicated(data))

# Check for Na's
colnames(data)[apply(data, 2, anyNA)]
```

```{r}
# Replace Na's in all variables/columns with median

# For heart Rate
median(data$heartRate, na.rm = T)
data$heartRate[is.na(data$heartRate)] <- median(data$heartRate, na.rm = T)

# For test A
median(data$testA, na.rm = T)
data$testA[is.na(data$testA)] <- median(data$testA, na.rm = T)

# For test B
median(data$testB, na.rm = T)
data$testB[is.na(data$testB)] <- median(data$testB, na.rm = T)

# For test C
median(data$testC, na.rm =T)
data$testC[is.na(data$testC)] <- median(data$testC, na.rm = T)

# For test D
median(data$testD, na.rm = T)
data$testD[is.na(data$testD)] <- median(data$testD, na.rm = T)

# For test E
median(data$testE, na.rm = T)
data$testE[is.na(data$testE)] <- median(data$testE, na.rm = T)

# For disease
median(data$disease, na.rm = T)
data$disease[is.na(data$disease)] <- median(data$disease, na.rm = T)

```

```{r}
# check for Na's 
colnames(data)[apply(data, 2, anyNA)]
```

### Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
summary(data$age)
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The summary of the age variable gives insight to the distribution of ages in dataset: The age ranges from 11 years to 76 years. The average is 43 years Half of the participants are younger than 44 years (median) and half are older.\
25% of the participants are younger than 37 years (1st quartile).\
25% of the participants are older than 49 years (3rd quartile).\
The mean value is less than the median, indicating the data is negatively skewed.
:::

```{r}
# View the internal structure of the data
str(data)
```

```{r}
# Convert the independent variable to a factor / levels  and view the structure
data[,'disease'] <- as.factor(data[,'disease'])
```

```{r}
# Using box plot to visualize the data
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x=disease, y=age, fill=disease))+geom_boxplot()+
  labs(title = "Box Plot of age by disease", x = "Disease", y ="Age")
```

**Analysis from the Box Plot:**

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The Box plot compared the age for two groups: those without the disease(0) and those with the disease(1). The median age for those with the disease appears to be slightly higher than for those without the disease. The box for those without the disease is smaller indicating less variability in age. The box for those with the disease is larger suggesting more age variability among those with the disease.

Both groups have outliers, represented by individual points on beyond the whiskers. The group with no disease has more visible outliers. The age range for those without the disease seems to be more concentrated. Those with the disease show a wider spread of ages, with a higher median and more variability. The group with the disease appears slightly skewed positively and the group without the disease is evenly distributed.

In summary while there are some differences in age between those with and without the disease or while age may play a role, the presence of outliers suggest age alone may not be a definite predictor of disease status
:::

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x=age, fill=factor(disease))) +
  geom_histogram(position="identity", alpha=0.7, binwidth = 20) +
  facet_wrap(~disease) +
  labs(title = "Histogram of age by disease", x = "Age", y = "Count")
```

::: {style="text-align:justify"}
**Analysis from the graph**

The plot is divided into two panels, one for each disease(0 and 1). The x-axis represent the age, ranging from 0 to 100 years. The y-axis shows the count of individuals in each age group\
**Disease = 0(left panel; pink)** The absence of no disease distribution appears to be skewed. Also there is a very high peak in the 25 - 50 age range. A sharp decline occurs after age 50. Very few individuals are the oldest age group(50 - 75)

**Disease = 1(right pink: blue)** There's a noticeable peak in the 25-50 age range, but it's less pronounced than in the disease=0 group. There's a more gradual decline in the 50-75 age range.\

In summary, those with the disease group has a more even distribution across age groups. Those without the disease is heavily concentrated in the younger age range. Younger individuals (25-50) without the disease are over represented in the sample. The presence of the disease seems to be associated with a more even age distribution, possibly suggesting it affects people across a broader age spectrum. The disease=0 group's sharp decline after 50 could indicate that older individuals without the disease are underrepresented in the sample, or that the disease becomes more common with age. There might be potential biases; The sample might not be representative of the general population, given the strong skew in the absence of disease group. There could be age-related factors influencing disease diagnosis or study participation. This complex study relationship between age and disease warrant further investigation

**Scatter plot**

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = age, y = weight)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  labs(title = "Scatter plot of Weight vs Age", x = "Age", y = "Weight")
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Analysis from the scatter plot

The age ranges from 15 to 75 years. Weight ranges from 125 to 225 kgs From the Plot there is a dense concentration of data points, indicating a large sample size The data forms a roughly oval shape widening as the age increases The appears to be a slightly positive correlation between age and weight. As the age increases it appears the upper limit tends to increase more noticeably than the lower limit As evidenced by the widening spread of points, weight variability increases age There is noticeably a dense cluster of points in the middle age range (30 - 50years) A few individuals have weights above 200 kgs across different age groups. The increasing variability in weight with age suggests that factors influencing weight become more diverse or impactful as people get older.

### Further Analysis Using Confirmatory Data Analysis

**Logistic regression(lg)**\
Ho = Age is not a factor to contracting the disease.\
H1 = Age is a factor to contract the disease.

```{r}
lg <- glm(disease ~ age,  family = "binomial", data = data)
summary(lg)
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Based on the results, the p value: \< 2e-16 is less than the sign. level(0.05) Therefore we reject the null hypothesis and accept the H1, which confirms that age is a factor to contract the disease
:::

**CHI-SQUARE TEST**\
Ho = No Significant association between marital status and ethnic group.\
H1 = There is significant association between marital status and ethnic group.

```{r}
chisq = chisq.test(data$ethnic, data$marital)
chisq
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Based on the analysis, the p value (0.2641) is greater than the significant level(0.05). Therefore we accept the null hypothesis and reject the alternative hypothesis, which confirms that there is no significant association between marital status and ethnic group
:::

**Linear Regression**\
Ho = Age does not contribute to height\
H1 = Age does contribute to height\

```{r}
lr <- lm(age ~ height, data)
summary(lr)
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
Based on the analysis, the p value(0.7706) is greater than the sign. value(0.05) Therefore we accept the null hypothesis and conclude age does not contribute to height.

### **A supervised classification tree model for disease prediction.**
:::

```{r}
# Check the structure of your data
str(data)
```

```{r}
# levels
levels(data$disease) = c(0,1)
```

```{r}
# let n be the variable that holds the number of rows
n <- nrow(data)
n
# 80% for training
trainIndex <- sample(1:n, size = round(0.8*n), replace = FALSE)
train <- data[trainIndex,]

# 20% for testing
test <- data[-trainIndex,]

# set seed
set.seed(1)
```

```{r}
# rpart
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
mod <- rpart(disease~., train)
mod

# predict
rpart.plot(mod)
pred <- predict(mod, test, type = "vector")
pred

# actual
act <- test[,'disease']
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The root node of the classification tree model is the first split and shows the most influential feature in predicting disease. In this model, heart rate is at the root, meaning it has the highest gain of information and it is the most important factor in determining disease.\
\
The tree continues to split the data further based on other features. These splits provide additional insights into how different combinations of features influence the prediction of disease.\
\
The model's decision-making process is based on reducing variance or error at each split. The tree prioritizes the feature that results in the best separation of data, leading to more accurate predictions of disease.
:::

**Model's Accuracy**

```{r}
# accuracy
confusion_matrix <- table(pred, act)
confusion_matrix


# Calculate accuracy
accuracy <- sum(diag(confusion_matrix)) / sum(confusion_matrix)
print(paste("Accuracy:", round(accuracy*100, 2), "%"))
```

::: {style="text-align: justify"}
The model seems to perform reasonably well overall, with an accuracy of 84%. This confusion matrix provides valuable insights into the model's performance and can help guide further refinement or decision-making based on the model's predictions.
:::

**Important Features**

```{r}
# this shows which variables are in important or influential in my model
importance <- mod$variable.importance
importance_df <- data.frame(feature = names(importance), importance = importance)
importance_df <- importance_df[order(-importance_df$importance),]
print(importance_df)
```
