# Data-Analytics

Welcome to my **Data Analytics Portfolio**, which includes structured projects in both **Data Science** and **Data Analysis**, implemented in **R** and **Python**.

This repository is organized to reflect both the **type of analytics** and the **programming language** used, demonstrating a range of skills from exploratory data analysis to machine learning modeling.
