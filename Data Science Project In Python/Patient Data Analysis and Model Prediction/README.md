# Patient-Data-Analysis-and-Model-Prediction

This project analyses the data of many patients (approximately 2000). The first data contains demographic and simple measurements (height, weight, etc). The second data also contains the results of 5 medical tests ranging from 0 to 100. It also indicates whether or not the patient has a disease (0=yes, 1=no). Both files have an ID for each patient which uniquely identifies the patient. Thus patient 34573 in the first file is the same as 34573 in the second.
